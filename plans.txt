General/Home:
√ add a subtle underline over the nav links when hovered over
√ maybe add a photo slideshow on the front page, first thing you see --> figure out the styling
    - work on how the image will look when on different devices
√ navigation on bottom
√ clicking photos will be viewed in fullscreen
- more animations to all stuff (simple fades in and out, hover, fullscreen fades etc.)
- FAQ (later)

Portfolio:
√ add folders to expand more on different types of photos (portraits, landscapes, city, etc)
? when hovering over nav bar, display different types of photos in a dropdown
√ when viewing folders, clicking a photo will view the photo in fullscreen
- add more folders and photos

About:
- About me (passion, what drove me, yap a bit)
- more professional photo
- maybe testimonials??
- socials (instagram)

Contact:
- add contact page duh
- simple form (name, email, session, etc.)
    - maybe use PHP? user adds info -> PHP sends contact info to my address

All Photos:
- just put everything there ig, slightly organized by different types
- more tightly packed grid, 5-6 tiles per row maybe

FUTURE/OTHER PLANS:
- setup a system where users can contact easily
√ a way to share photos to users after sessions, make them easily accessible and downloadable
    - work on making it more secure, easier to download, and a bit nicer
    - figure out how to automate the process, scripts (Node.js?)
- make page responsive to other devices
- learn how to photograph cars lol
- for a possible pricing page: use JS to create a basic tool to calculate estimated cost.
    - have check boxes for things that the user wants -> calculate estimated total.
    - easy way for user to calculate their budget and desired total.
- (after development) make a login system for admins
    - admins (me duh) can edit what photos are displayed on the page
    - admins can also upload photos taken from sessions to give to clients
